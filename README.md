# Goodreads Wrapped: A Shiny App for Visualizing Your Reading Journey

Hey there! I'm excited to share version 2.0 of my Goodreads visualization project. Last year, I built this tool using Streamlit to help visualize reading habits (check out the [original version here](https://github.com/gigikenneth/goodreads)), and now I've rebuilt it using R Shiny, adding a bunch of new features and giving it a pretty pink makeover with help from [Claude](https://claude.ai/).

## What's New in 2.0? 
I've kept all the others things from the original version but made them even better:
- Added a cute pink theme throughout the app (because why not?)
- Made the tables searchable and more interactive
- Created better visualizations for your reading stats
- Added a new Books section to browse through your entire collection
- Improved the word cloud to show your reading interests better

## What Can You Do With It?
1. 📚 Get a nice overview of your reading life with total books, ratings, and pages read
2. ⭐ See how you tend to rate books (are you a tough critic or an easy pleaser?)
3. 📈 Track how your reading habit has grown over time
4. 📚 Browse through all your books in one place
5. ✍️ Find out which authors you can't get enough of
6. 📖 See if you prefer doorstoppers or quick reads
7. 🌟 Get a pretty word cloud of your book titles

## Want to Try It?
It's super easy to get started:

1. Grab your data from Goodreads:
   - Head to Goodreads.com and go to "My Books"
   - Look for "Import and Export"
   - Hit "Export Library"

2. Then just:
   - Upload your file to the app
   - Or hit "Try Example Data" if you just want to explore.

## Built Using
I used R Shiny for this version, along with some cool libraries like Plotly for interactive charts and WordCloud2 for the title visualization. The whole thing is wrapped in a pretty pink bow, thanks to custom CSS styling.

I'd love to hear what you think about this new version! Feel free to try it out, and let me know if you have any suggestions for making it even better. 💕
